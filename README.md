# Welcome
Welcome to my college portfolio! 

All of the work you'll view here was completed during my time at DigiPen Institute of Technology - Redmond while I was pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Game Design. This degree taught me both computer science and design principles that I got to apply in the work contained here.

This is a work-in-progress portfolio! Transferring four years of work over to GitHub in a readable fashion takes a while. To show the overall progress of the port, I've included a checklist down below outlining everything I am planning to add. This is a double pronged effort that includes a revitilization of my personal website as well!
