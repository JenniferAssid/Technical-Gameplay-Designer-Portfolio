# Looking Into the Project  
For the first half of the class, each person was tasked with creating a unique game idea within the properiety DigiPen engine, CProcessing. The following project is a cumulation of three assignments and includes a splash screen (that meets TCRs), a main menu (with interesting UI), and a single level demonstrating the concept. Through peer-to-peer learning and vast amounts of research, I was able to create this small prototype remotely (due to the COVID-19 pandemic).  

# Downloading the Release Build  
To experience the prototype first hand, I have gone in and created a Release build. Download the 'Release Build - Jennifer Assid - Dimension Switching Platformer' folder, unzip in a directory of your choosing, and double-click the .exe within.
