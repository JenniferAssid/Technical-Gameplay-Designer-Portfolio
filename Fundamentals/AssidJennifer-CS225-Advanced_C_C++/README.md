# Welcome!
The following program is the collection of all programming completed by me, Jennifer Assid, during CS225 (course details below) while at DigiPen Institute of Technology. Though the program interworkings (i.e., getting a single executable to include all of the work) was completed in 2024, the 'substance' comes from the year mentioned below.

Through commenting, I have clearly stated what code I own and what code I do not (there are some course provided drivers used to run functions I wrote). Following the course details, I have provided an overview on what the program contains:

## Course Details
**Name:** CS225: Advanced C/C++
**Instructor:** Dmitri Volper
**Semester:** Fall 2021
**Description:** This course builds on the foundation created in the first two high-level programming courses (CS 120 and CS 170). It presents advanced topics of the C/C++ programming language in greater
detail. Such topics include advanced pointer manipulation, utilizing multi-dimensional arrays, complex declarations, and standard library functions. Advanced C++ topics include class and function templates, operator overloading, multiple inheritance, runtime type information, the standard template library, and performance issues.

# Downloading the Release Build
For ease of use, I have provided a Release build that has the application (and all necessary files) to download. Simply download and unzip the 'AssidJennifer-CS225-Advanced_C_C++-ReleaseBuild' and double-click the 'AssidJennifer-CS225-Advanced_C_C++.exe', double-click it and explore!

# Look Into the Program
The application functions on a simple state-machine run by enums and demonstrates a basic inheritance structure by employing object-oriented programming within the C++ language.

## Labs
Every week, there were labs that needed to be completed. Labs were small tasks to show understanding of weekly material within the class. Said labs have been ported into the project with the descriptions from each posted below.

**00 - Readline:** Reads all characters before a new line (/n), places them in a buffer, and returns the result

**01 - Replace:** Iterates through a given string to find a given subscript and replace that subscript with a given replacement.If the modified string is too large for the buffer, false is returned.

**02 - Cipher:** Takes encrypted text and decodes it as wellas vice versa

**03 - tddaa:** Allocates and deallocates

**04 - Matrix:** Contains all the functions needed to create, manipulate, and analyze matrices

**05 - Ray Intersection:** Contains various shape variablest to run ray intersections against

**06 - Rational:** Demonstrates operator overloads

**07 - Deque:** Contains all the functions for a deque list

**08 - Deque Template:** Contains all the functions for a deque list - templatized

**09 - Functions:** Various functions that deal with values - templatized

**10 - Polynomial:** Different polynomial functions - operator overloads and templates

## Assignments
Every two weeks an assignment was due. Similar to the labs, assignments were a chance to demonstrate understanding of class materials. However, they usually were more complex and challenges - hence the more longer timeline to complete.

**00 - Splitter:** This program holds functions necessary to split, join, and analayze files

**01 - Sparsevector:** This program holds functions necessary to manipulate and maintained a sparsevector

**02 - Sparsevector C++:** This program holds functions necessary to manipulate and maintained a sparsevector - now in C++

**03 - Lazycopy:** This program holds functions necessary to manipulate and maintained an array
