# Welcome!
The following program is the collection of all programming completed by me, Jennifer Assid, during CS170 (course details below) while at DigiPen Institute of Technology. Though the program interworkings (i.e., getting a single executable to include all of the work) was completed in 2024, the 'substance' comes from the year mentioned below.

Through commenting, I have clearly stated what code I own and what code I do not (there are some course provided drivers used to run functions I wrote). Following the course details, I have provided an overview on what the program contains:

## Course Details
**Name:** CS170: High-Level Programming II: The C++ Language
**Instructor:** Dmitri Volper
**Semester:** Spring 2021
**Description:** This course introduces the C++ language with particular emphasis on its object-oriented features. Topics include stylistic and usage differences between C and C++, namespaces, function and operator overloading, classes, inheritance, templates, and fundamental STL components.
*Description copied from the 2020-2021 DigiPen Course Catalog*

# Downloading the Release Build
For ease of use, I have provided a Release build that has the application (and all necessary files) to download. Simply download the 'ReleaseBuild-AssidJennifer-CS170-High_Level_Programming_II.exe', double-click it and explore!

# Look Into the Program
The application functions on a simple state-machine run by enums and demonstrates a basic inheritance structure by employing object-oriented programming within the C++ language.

## Labs
Every week, there were labs that needed to be completed. Labs were small tasks to show understanding of weekly material within the class. Said labs have been ported into the project with the descriptions from each posted below.

**00 - Fibonacci:** This program takes a number and creates a table containing every Fibonacci number and quotient from 0 to the number given.
**01 - List Lab - v0:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain linked lists.
**02 - List Lab - v1:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain linked lists contained in a List class.
**03 - List Lab - v2:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain linked lists contained in a List class - now with additional functionality.
**04 - List Lab - v3:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain linked lists contained in a List class - now with merging.
**05 - List Lab - v4:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain linked lists contained in a List class - now with duplicate testing.
**06 - Vector Lab - v0:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain an array of numbers within a class Vector.
**07 - Vector Lab - v1:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain an array of numbers within a class Vector - now with operator overloads.
**08 - Vector Lab - v2:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain an array of numbers within a class Vector - additional functionality.
**09 - Vector Lab - v3:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain an array of numbers within a class Vector - binary search.

## Assignments
Every two weeks an assignment was due. Similar to the labs, assignments were a chance to demonstrate understanding of class materials. However, they usually were more complex and challenges - hence the more longer timeline to complete.

**00 - War Boats:** This program holds functions necessary to establish, update, and track the playing of 'Battleship'.
**01 - War Boats Object Oriented:** Similar to War Boats but all code is now contained in classes (object-oriented).
**02 - Point:** This program contains overloaded operators to manipulate class Point.
**03 - Table:** This program contains functions pertaining to the creation, maintenance, and manipulation of 2D string arrays.
**04 - List:** This program houses functions necessary to create, analyize, and maintain a linked list of numbers within a class List.
**05 - List Template:** Similar to List but utilizes the template functionality
