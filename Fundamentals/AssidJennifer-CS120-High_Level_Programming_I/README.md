# Welcome!
The following program is the collection of all programming completed by me, Jennifer Assid, during CS120 (course details below) while at DigiPen Institute of Technology. Though the program interworkings (i.e., getting a single executable to include all of the work) was completed in 2024, the 'substance' comes from the year mentioned below.

Through commenting, I have clearly stated what code I own and what code I do not (there are some course provided drivers used to run functions I wrote). Following the course details, I have provided an overview on what the program contains ()

## Course Details
**Name:** CS120: High-Level Programming I: The C Language
**Instructor:** Alex Carter
**Semester:** Fall 2020
**Description:** This course serves as a foundation for all high-level programming courses and projects by introducing control flow through statement grouping, decision making, case selection, and procedure iteration as well as basic data types. Additionally, this course addresses the lexical convention, syntax notation, and semantics of the C programming language.

# Downloading the Release Build
For ease of use, I have provided a Release build that has the application (and all necessary files) to download. Simply download the 'ReleaseBuild-AssidJennifer_CS120' folder, unzip it in a directory of your choosing, and double-click the .exe within.

# Look Into the Program
The application functions on a simple state-machine run by enums. To keep with the 'C' language consistency of the original assignments, the program framework is C based. The dates of creation for all of the files are listed in a comment block at the top of each.

## Labs
Every week, there were labs that needed to be completed. Labs were small tasks to show understanding of weekly material within the class. Said labs have been ported into the project with the descriptions from each posted below.

**00 - marathon:** Calculates how many yards are within a marathon. Demonstrates understanding of the main() function, #define use-cases, library utilization, variable initialization/types, and arithmetic.
**01 - numbers:** This program takes three inputs, calculates their sin/cos/tan/atan values, and prints the results in a table. Demontrates handling user input, storing returned values, and printf formatting.
**02 - cubes:** Contains two functions: print_cubes and print_pythagorean_triples

    print_cubes goes through all three digit numbers (100 - 999) and determines which three-digit numbers have the cube property but cubing each of the number's digits, adding their cubes together, and comparing their sum to the number.

    print_pythagorean_triples goes through a series of three digits ranging from any two inputted integers, determines whether the three digits make up a Pythagorean Triple bys eeing if the sum of the squares of the first two digits equal the square of the second, then print out the digits and squares in a chart.
**03 - dates:** Takes two dates from user input and determines if the first date is before, after, or the same as the second date. Demonstrates use of if/else statements and conditional logic.
**04 - prime:** Determining is a number is prime as well as displaying that all even numbers within a range are the sum of two prime #s. Demonstrates use of modulo and for loops.
**05 - sieve:** Holds functions that do different things with the same array and range of numbers. Demonstrates use of arrays.
**06 - calendar:** Holds functions is_leapyear; day_of_the_week; and print_calendar. Reinforces previously demonstrated concepts.
**07 - histogram:** Holds the functions GetCounts(), PrintHistograms(), GetStatistics() which all analyze and derive statistics such as a histogram, average, and mode of a given string. Demonstrates string manipulation.
**08 - tablen:** Analyzes a file to check for tabs and long lines. Demonstrates file I/O and handling.
**09 - list:** Holds the functions that manipulate, assess, and output various linked lists. Demonstrates linked list maintenance and manipulation.

## Assignments
Every two weeks an assignment was due. Similar to the labs, assignments were a chance to demonstrate understanding of class materials. However, they usually were more complex and challenges - hence the more longer timeline to complete.

**00 - pi:** Takes user input and uses it as iterations to run through the Riemann Sum and Leibniz equations to give an output via table.
**01 - arrays:** Various functions manipulating arrays.
**02 - palindrome:** Determines if an array of characters is a palindrome based off of array notation.
**03 - bytes:** Includes functions that analyze and manipulate strings.
**04 - scantext:** Analyzes and manipulate given strings based on input.
**05 - spellcheck:** Analyze strings to a given file.
