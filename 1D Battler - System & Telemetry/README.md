# Welcome!
This folder contains all of the work assocated with the 1D Battler systems and telemetry assignment! This project was one of two in the course described below and focused on the balance/playtesting of a game system.

## Course Details
**Name:** DES212: System Design Methods
**Instructor:** Benjamin Ellinger
**Semester:** Spring 2022
**Description:** This course is an introduction to game design theory and
the process of designing games. Topics may include design
principles, writing rules, playtesting, game state, randomness,
hidden information, and game balance.

# Downloading the Release Build
Each iteration of this project is provided (along side their individual builds). To experience them, navigate to the Build folder inside each and double click the .exe

# Look Into the Assignment
This project went throug many iterations. I have provided builds that demonstrate its evolution at every step.

## Ranged Combat
Adds ranged combat to the melee combat that was included in the simulator. Additional items that were added were UI for the player, unique enemies, and flavor text to keep the experience interesting.

Also includes a playtesting report of the iteration.

## Group Combat
Adds groups for the player to fight against. Goes into the balancing between different enemy types, interesting group compositions, and additional functionality for the player (e.g., selecting which enemy to attack).

Also includes a playtesting report of the iteration.

## Balanced Combat
Tweaks were made to the original based on the playtesting feedback demonstrated earlier

## Automated Combat
Added automation to the combat system alongside telemetry tracking.

## Final Project
A cumulation of all of the work. For more detail, read the README.md file in the Final Combat folder.
