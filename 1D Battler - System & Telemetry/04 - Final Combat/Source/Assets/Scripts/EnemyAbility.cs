Description:
	This file is part of the framework for the 1D Combat Simulator assignment in
	DES 212 (System Design Methods). It can be freely used and modified by students
	for that assignment.
	
    This component makes a game object an enemy ability. The game object then must
    be parented to the actual enemy game object in order to work. Should this really
    be a different class than the hero ability? It doesn duplicate some functionality,
    but often hero and enemy abilities end up subtly different, so this can be okay to do.

	The big modification I made to this file has to do with the healer enemy
