For the Final Combat of the 1D Battler, I have included the following information:

## Analytical Analysis
In the Excel file (.xlsx), I have used the telemetry from the game to create a comprehensive look into the internal systems and provide explanations.

## Playtest Report
Similar to the first two iterations of the battler, I have included a playtest report going over player's experiences with the final iteration.

## Build
A playable build of the final iteration

## Source
A copy of the relevant source files. This project was based off of a template provided by the teacher. I have done my best to comment my adjustments and contributions to the template files.
